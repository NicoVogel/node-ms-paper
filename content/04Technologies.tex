\chapter{Selection of Technologies for Prototyping}\label{cha:Technologies}

One of the core aspects of a microservice architecture is the communication \cite[p.~60]{Bruce.2019}.
This includes the inter-microservice communication but also the communication beyond the microservice environment to the client itself.
Especially after the deployment, monitoring systems are crucial for operation, in order to collect metrics and observe the system \cite[p.~313]{Bruce.2019}.
With a preceding research, criteria based on the requirements researched in chapter \ref{cha:Requirement} are used to determine, which technology should be tested through prototypes.

\textbf{Researching Technologies}

In order to select technologies and frameworks for development of prototypes for evaluation, research is needed in both aforementioned aspects of a microservice environment, namely communication and monitoring, to find possible technologies.
Although other aspects, such as testing, project build and deployment, and engines are important, these are deliberately left out due to the timely boundaries of this work.
In the following either practical implementations of protocols or complete frameworks for both aspects are presented briefly.
