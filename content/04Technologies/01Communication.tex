Generally speaking, communication can be done synchronously or asynchronously.
In the context of a microservice architecture, asynchronous communication is highly recommended due to its decoupled and non-blocking nature.
Although such an event based communication is favorable in distributed systems, as in microservices, synchronous messaging may also be used, if a specific behavior in another service is needed \cite[p~.34f]{Hofmann.2016}\cite[p.~89]{Newman.2015}.
Consequently, both forms of service communication need to be analyzed separately.
