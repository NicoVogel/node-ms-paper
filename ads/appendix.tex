\chapter{Expert interviews}
\label{chp:appendix:interview}

Two expert interviews were conducted as part of this work.
The goal was to gain information on what is important as a member of a development team for a  distributed communication system.
This information was used to shape the developer and operator personas.

\paragraph{Developer interview}

The interview was conducted on the 20.05.2020 with an managing solution architect.
He has worked for 13 years, among others as software engineer and solution architect in projects with focus on API management, distributed architecture and integration systems.
This interview is the reference \cite{ManagingSolutionArchitect.20.05.2020}.

\paragraph{Operator interview}

The interview was conducted on the 20.05.2020 with an enterprise architect for cloud based infrastructure.
He has worked for 20 years, among others as project manager, lead architect and DevOps subject matter expert.
This interview is the reference \cite{EnterpriseArchitectforcloudbasedinfrastructure.20.05.2020}.

\chapter{Benchmark of asynchronous messaging prototypes}
\label{chp:appendix:benchmark}

Each asynchronous prototype needed to handle 10000 messages from one producer and these were distributed to 10 consumers.
Both benchmark runs were executed on the same machine.
The results from RabbitMQ (\ref{listing:rabbitbenchmark}) show one transmission with a sending time of 283 ms and average receiving time of 4630,3ms.
In Apache Kafka there were three different producer implementations which were evaluated.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Type 1 (T1): each message was send and the response was immediately awaited.
    \item Type 2 (T2): all messages were send, the promises were collected in an array and all awaited at once with \textit{Promise.all()}
    \item Type 3 (T3): all messages were send and no response was awaited, except for the last response (which is the end signal)
\end{itemize}

The results from Apache Kafka are shown in \ref{listing:kafkabenchmark} and the following list shows on overview of the results.

\begin{itemize}
    \item T1: producer 42,7 s and consumer 42,7 s (average)
    \item T2: producer 22,3 s and consumer 22,4 s (average)
    \item T3: producer 21,6 s and consumer 21,7 s (average)
\end{itemize}
